When writing blogs always follow these rules:

1. Structural Components

    The "Hook" Intro: First 150 words must validate the user's pain point and promise a specific outcome. No fluff.

    TLDR section (after introduction) summarizing the "One Big Thing".

    Table of contents with anchor links.

    "Experience" Boxes: Personal anecdotes or specific agency case studies (E-E-A-T signals).

    Feature boxes, warning boxes, tip boxes.

    Step-by-step frameworks (Must be actionable, not theoretical).

    Comparison tables (Pros/Cons explicitly stated).

    FAQ section (Based on "People Also Ask" questions).

    Strong CTA (Contextual to the user's stage in the funnel).

    Internal links (User-provided).

    External links (AI-optimized).

    Proper heading structure (H2/H3/H4 hierarchy).

2. Content Requirements (The Human Layer)

    Tone: Professional, data-driven, empathetic, and authoritative.

    The "So What?" Test: Every statistic must explain why it matters to the reader.

    Pain-Agitation-Solution (PAS) Framework: Identify the struggle before offering the fix.

    Scannability First: No paragraph longer than 3-4 lines.

    Mixed content types (Lists, Tables, Quotes).

    Mobile-responsive design.

    Depth over Length: Cover the topic comprehensively (est. 1500-2500 words), but do not use filler.

3. Keyword & Semantic Strategy

    Primary Goal: Satisfy User Intent (Answer the query faster/better than competitors).

    Semantic Variations: Use natural synonyms and related industry terms (LSI).

    Natural Placement: Keywords in H2s and first 100 words, but prioritize flow over math. Do not force density.

4. Link Integration Strategy

    Internal Links:

        Place in contextually relevant sections (e.g., "See our Matura Course for details").

        Goal: Keep the user on the site (reduce bounce rate).

    External Links:

        Link to non-competitor authorities (e.g., British Council, Cambridge, Gov data).

        Purpose: To cite sources and build trust, not just to have links.
